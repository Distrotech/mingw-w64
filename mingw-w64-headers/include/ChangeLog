	* iprtrmib.h (TCP_TABLE_CLASS): New.

2010-03-18  Ozkan Sezer  <sezeroz@gmail.com>

	Do not silently include winsock2.h instead of winsock.h:
	* winsock.h: Removed the if 0 comment out and the winsock2.h
	include. Restored the recently removed definitions.
	* ws2ipdef.h: Deleted.
	* winsock2.h: Define _WINSOCKAPI_ to avoid winsock.h inclusions.
	Removed the _WINSOCK_SOCKET_DEFINED ifdef guards around SOCKET
	definitions. Removed mswsock.h inclusion.
	* mswsock.h: Removed the SOCKET definitions.
	* ws2tcpip.h: Added back ip_mreq and ip_mreq_source structures.
	Do not try to preserve possible socklen_t macros from the user.
