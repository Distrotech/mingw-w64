/* _dowildcard is an int that controls the globbing of the command line.
 * If _dowildcard is non-zero, the command line will be globbed:  *.*
 * will be expanded to be all files in the startup directory.
 * In the mingw-w64 library the _dowildcard variable is defined as being
 * 0, therefore command line globbing is DISABLED by default. To turn it
 * on and to leave wildcard command line processing MS's globbing code,
 * include a line in one of your source modules defining _dowildcard and
 * setting it to -1, like so:
 * int _dowildcard = -1;
